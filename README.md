# ascribe API

The Secure Public Online Ownership Ledger (SPOOL). This REST-api provides a JSON interface for the SPOOL protocol.

## Note

The original spoolio repository (on GitHub) contained some sensitive information in its Git history, so the files were copied, the sensitive information was redacted, and a new Git repository was created: spoolio-copy. If you're an internet historian and want to look at an archive of the original spoolio repository, then contact @ttmc.
